<h3>Conclusions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Model B offers the highest storage capacity among the three models, making it suitable for users who need more space for apps and media.</li>
    <li>Model C is the most affordable option, but it has the least storage, which might be a limitation for users with high storage needs.</li>
    <li>Model A provides a balance between price and storage, making it a good choice for users who need more storage than Model C but are not willing to pay as much as for Model B.</li>
